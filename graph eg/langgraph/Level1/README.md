# Level 1: Simple LLM Call with LangGraph

This example demonstrates how to make a simple call to a Large Language Model (LLM) using the [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) library.

## Overview
- The code in `agent.py` sets up a minimal LangGraph workflow to send a prompt to an LLM and receive a response.
- This is a foundational example to help you understand how to use LangGraph for basic LLM interactions.

## How it works
1. The user provides an input prompt.
2. The prompt is sent to the LLM using LangGraph's graph execution.
3. The LLM's response is returned and displayed.

## Output
The result of running the code is shown below:

The image above shows a sample output generated by the LLM in response to a user prompt.

# Level 1.1: LLM Call with LangGraph to accept input from user input

This example demonstrates how to make a simple call to a Large Language Model (LLM) using the [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) library.

## Overview
- The code in `agent_user_inline.py` sets up a minimal LangGraph workflow to send a user input to an LLM and receive a response.
- User can ask multiple questions till user exit from terminal

## How it works
1. The user provides an input prompt through command line.
2. The prompt is sent to the LLM using LangGraph's graph execution.
3. The LLM's response is returned and displayed till the time user exit.

## Output
The result of running the code is shown below:

![Output](output/output_user_input.png)

The image above shows a sample output generated by the LLM in response to a user prompt.
